              Education is empowerment. We focus on education content as well as
              the required tools to provide education to a billion people.
              Through simple technologies like video conferencing, and the
              infrastructure technology from ThreeFold, we connect students with
              educators around the world.

              Our Digital Nation needs a set of safe complementary digital
